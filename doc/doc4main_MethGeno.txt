=head1 NAME

ChIPseqBioinforCore onestop - Default analysis for processing ChIP-seq data.

=head1 VERSION

0.0

=head1 SYNOPSIS

perl ChIPseqBioinforCore_vx.x.x.pl onestop 
--project_dir directory to store the results
--data_dir directory for data 
--reference ref_index 
--fastq_surfix fq 
--core_num 10 
--SICER pair_list,...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Onestop will help you process ChIP-seq data from the raw sequencde
data, including default deconseq step, cutadapt step and mapping step, as well
as calling peaks using SICER, calling diff-peaks using SICER-df. 

=head1 Options

=over 8

=item B<-help> | B<-h>

 - Prints the help message and exists.

=item B<project_dir [required]>

 - Provide the data for output

=item B<data_dir [required]>

 - Provide the data for input data

=item B<reference [required]>

 - Provide the information for bowtie2 index

=item B<fastq_surfix>

 - The surfix for fastq files [fq, fq.gz, fastq, fastq.gz]. READ1 should be
   named as "*_1.FASTQ_SURFIX". READ2 should be named as "*_2.FASTQ_SURFIX".
   For COMPRESSED files, this pipelines only take "gzip"ped files. 
   Default: fq

=item B<queue>

 - Queue you want to use. [Default: bioinf-b on hansen]

=item B<core_num>

 - CPU cores you want to use. [default number: 1]

=item B<SICER [not required]>

 - If you provide this parameter, indicates that you want to call peaks using
   SICER.
   NO space is allowed.Input should be concatenated using comma "," in 
   specific order shown as below:

   <pairlist,Species,Redundancy_threshold,Win_size[bp],Fragment_size,Effective
   _genome_fraction,Gap_size,FDR>

   Please see SICER manual for detailed information.
   
   Pair list should follow specific format. You can write comment lines
   startting with #.  The file should be space-delimited (tab preferred). 
   For each column, NO space is allowed.
   | Column 1 |  Column 2   | Column 3 | Column 4|
   | Tissue   | HisMod Type |     IP   |  Input  |

   The first column could be tissue, genotype, etc. It's OK as long as the
   conbination of first and second column is unique.

=item B<SICER2DiffBind [not required]>

  - If you provide this parameter, indicates that you want to call peaks using
   DiffBind. <SICER> has to be provided. 

=item B<SICERdf [not required]>

 - If you provide this parameter, indicates that you want to call differential 
   peaks using SICER-df. 
   NO space is allowed. Input should be concatenated using comma "," in 
   specific order shown as below:
   <window_size>,<gap_size>,<FDR_for_KO_vs_KOCONTROL_or_WT_vs_WTCONTROL>,
   <FDR_for_WT_vs_KO>,<Species><Redundancy_threshold>

   Please see SICER manual for detailed information.

   Pair list should follow specific format. You can write comment lines startting
   with #. The file should be space-delimited (tab preferred). For each column, 
   NO space is allowed. 
   
   | Column 1 |  Column 2   | Column 3 | Column 4 | Column 3 | Column 4 |
   | Tissue   | HisMod Type |  KO_IP   | KO_Input |  WT_IP   | WT_Input |

   The first column could be tissue, genotype, etc. It's OK as long as the
   conbination of first and second column is unique.
